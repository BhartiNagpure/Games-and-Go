# Fifteen Sliding Puzzle Game

--- 

## **Description ðŸ“ƒ**

- A simple implementation of the classic mini-game Fifteen Sliding Puzzle, using HTML DOM document elements and without using Canvas or third party libraries. 

- When mixing a picture, random replacement of slots is not used, only natural mixing by moving a free slot, thanks to this, an error is excluded, due to which the puzzle may not be assembled.

- By solving the puzzle, you can move several blocks in a column and a row in one move. You can set controls for the GamePad and keyboard.

- The engine code is very flexible for modifications, has many settings and can be integrated into any web page or web app.
